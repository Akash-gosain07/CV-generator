This is a full-stack Resume Builder web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The main purpose of this project is to help users create clean, ATS-friendly resumes without struggling with formatting. It includes a modern resume editor with live preview, multiple templates, and PDF export, so users can build and download their resume in a few minutes. I also added Indian sample data (college, internships, projects, etc.) to make it more useful for Indian students and freshers. The UI is designed like a premium SaaS product with smooth animations and responsive layout across all devices.
