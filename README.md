This is a full-stack Resume Builder website made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
The main goal of this project is to help users build ATS-friendly resumes with a clean UI, live preview, and easy PDF download.

It also comes with Indian sample data so anyone in India (college students / interns / freshers) can quickly generate a proper resume and modify it based on their needs.

What this project does

✅ Users can register/login and save their resumes
✅ Create multiple resumes under one account
✅ Edit resume sections like education, skills, projects, experience etc.
✅ Live preview while editing
✅ Switch between different templates
✅ Export the resume as a PDF
✅ Works properly on mobile, tablet and laptop screens

Templates included
I added multiple templates to cover different use cases like:
Normal professional resume
Minimal modern resume
Placement style resume (college/IIT format)
Creative tech resume (still ATS safe)
Govt/UPSC-style bio-data format
